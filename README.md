## 🧮 Cost of Land Project

Welcome to the **Cost of Land** project—an interactive Python program built to calculate and break down the total cost of land purchases using modular functions. This project was submitted as part of my coursework at Fayetteville State University and showcases foundational Python concepts in a clean, readable format.

## 🔧 What It Does

- Accepts user input for land dimensions and cost per unit
- Calculates area, total cost, tax, and final price using **5 modular functions**
- Incorporates **input validation** and **formatted output**
- Designed with clarity and reusability in mind—perfect for beginner and intermediate Python learners

## 💡 Educational Purpose

This project reflects my growth in:
- 🐍 Python Programming: functions, arguments, return statements, modularity
- 📐 Math Logic: calculating area and price totals
- 🧠 Problem-Solving: structuring code step-by-step for readability
- 🧾 Compliance Mindset: keeping output tidy and accurate—transferable to fraud detection and audit workflows
